   <h2>  Campus Involvements</h2>
   <p>
       In June 2019, I studied abroad and lived in Rome, Italy. Clubs that I have been a member of include Women in Business Student Organization, DECA (secretary), and Mortar Board (President).
       Greek life has allowed me to serve my community and has exposed me to leadership positions. I was on the Party Planning committee, Bid Day committee, Panhellenic Affairs committee, and served as the Photography chair. 
       Also, I am a member of Order of Omega, MSU's Greek honor society. I have been a member of the Honors College since Spring 2018. 
   </p>

   <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
   <p>
       Starting Spring 2021, I will be dual-enrolled in MSU's Master's of Science in Marketing Research program, which is ranked #1 in the world.
       After graduating in December 2021, I will hopefully live in a big city with warm weather working as a consultant for a market research firm.
